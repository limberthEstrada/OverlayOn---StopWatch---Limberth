Today you will need to create 2 components. The first one will be a countdown and the second one a count up.

You already have ready all the properties that the component need in the storybook. What do you need to do? Here is the list of the task:
- Create the logic to show the countdown time when is paused.
- Create the logic to show the countdown time when is playing. The time should going down.
- Change the countdown design to something spectacular.
- Create the logic to show the count up time when is paused.
- Create the logic to show the count up time when is playing. The time should going up.
- Add the same design of the countdown to the count up

Extra tasks
- Make the styles of the countdown editable from props.
- Add new storybook of the countdown with a button to start and stop the countdown.

You can make any changes or refactor you want or use any libraries you want. When you finish the test send us the answer with a description of why you use the things you use.
